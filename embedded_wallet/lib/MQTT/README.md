# MQTT for Photon, Spark Core
<a href="http://mqtt.org/" target=_blank>MQTT</a> publish/subscribe library for Photon, Spark Core version 0.4.21.

## Source Code
This lightweight library source code are only 2 files. firmware -> MQTT.cpp, MQTT.h.

Application can use QOS0,1,2 and retain flag when send a publish message.

## Example
Some sample sketches for Spark Core and Photon included(firmware/examples/).
 - mqtttest.ino	: simple pub/sub sample.
 - mqttqostest.ino : QoS1, QoS2 publish and callback sample.

## Arduino compatible
This library is Arduino compatible. Arduino version is <a href="https://github.com/hirotakaster/MQTT/tree/arduino">here</a>.


## developer examples
some applications use MQTT with Photon. here are developer's reference examples.

## FAQ
### Can't connect/publish/subscribe to the MQTT server?
- Check your MQTT server and port(default 1883) is really working with the mosquitto_pub/sub command. And maybe your MQTT server can't connect from Internet because of firewall. Check your network environments.
- Check your subscribe/publish topic name is really matched.
- Perhaps device firmware network stack is failed. check your firmware version and bugs.
- If you use MQTT-TLS, check your RooT CA pem file, client key, certifications is okay or not.
- Several MQTT server will disconnect to the 1st connection when you use the same user_id. When the application call the connect method, use different user_id in every devices in connect method's 2nd argument. Use MAC address as a user_id will be better.
<pre>
   // device.1
   client.connect("spark-client", "user_1", "password1");
   // other devices...
   client.connect("spark-client", "user_others", "password1");
</pre>

### I want to change MQTT keep alive timeout.
MQTT keepalive timeout is defined "MQTT_DEFAULT_KEEPALIVE 15"(15 sec) in header file. You can change the keepalive timeout in constructor.
<pre>
    MQTT client("server_name", 1883, callback); // default: send keepalive packet to MQTT server in every 15sec.
    MQTT client("server_name", 1883, 30, callback); // keepliave timeout is 30sec.
</pre>

### Want to use over the 255 message size.
In this library, max MQTT message size is defined "MQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE 255" in header file. But If you want to use over 255bytes, use the constructor 4th argument.
<pre>
    MQTT client("server_name", 1883, callback); // default 255bytes
    MQTT client("server_name", 1883, MQTT_DEFAULT_KEEPALIVE, callback, 512); // max 512bytes
</pre>

### Can I use on old firmware?
No, use default latest firmware. I test this library on default latest firmware or latest pre-release version. If you really want to use old firmware(I think don't need that case), maybe it can't work well and it is out of my assumption.

### Bug or Problem?
First of all, check the <a href="https://community.particle.io/" target="_blank">Particle community site<a/>. But still problem will not solve, please send a bug-fixed diff and Pull request or problem details to issue.
